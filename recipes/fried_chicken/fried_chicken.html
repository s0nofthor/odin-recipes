<p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This dish is one of the best out there, the only thing holding it back is that it seems impossible to find a good way to make it without using a crazy amount of frying oil. Well, the impossible seems more probable when you look at this recipe for fried chicken that only needs an air fryer to cook in. This makes it super easy to cook and much less of a hassle to clean, while also taking surprisingly little time.</p>
