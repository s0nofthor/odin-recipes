<p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Not only is this classic dish one of the tastiest and easiest to throw together, but the relative simplicity along with an extra ingredient makes it ridiculously healthy. On top of all of these benefits, following the recipe will give you 5 entire meals worth of guilt free italy discs that costs a little over a dollar per pie.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>500g All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>100g Vital Wheat Gluten</li>
            <li>10g salt</li>
            <li>5g Yeast</li>
            <li>440g Water</li>
            <li>1 can Cento Crushed Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1.5g Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>6g Salt</li>
            <li>300g Part-Skim Low-Moisture Mozzarella</li>
        </ul>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, gluten, salt, and yeast in a large bowl and whisk together until evenly mixed</li>
        <li>Add water and stir with a spoon until it's as incorporated as possible</li>
        <li>Get hand wet with more water and mix the rest of the dough in by hand until there are no dry ingredients left. Re-wet hand as necessary and be careful not to use too much water.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and let rise for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>After rising, spray hands with oil to prevent sticking and give the dough a nice stretch and fold four times, each from a different direction, and roll it into a ball</li>
        <li>Put the dough ball on your work surface and divide it into 5 hunks that weigh about 200-210g each</li>
        <li>Store 4 of the doughs in the fridge for later meals and let the dough that has been left out rise for another hour. If prepping a pre-prepared dough from the fridge, it should be left to rise for two.</li>
        <li>Add salt and garlic powder to the can of tomatoes and mix thoroughly</li>
        <li>Shred cheese if needed</li>
        <li>Once dough is ready, preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Put dough in a nostick pan about 10 inches wide and knead it out to the desired shape</li>
        <li>Add 80g of sauce followed by 60g of cheese</li>
        <li>Put in oven and let cook for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>After taking the pizza out, put it on a stovetop for about one and a half to two minutes to add more crunch to the crust if desired</li>
        <li>Let cool for five minutes, slice, and enjoy!</li>
